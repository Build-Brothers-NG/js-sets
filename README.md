# js-sets _[by BUILDBROTHERS.COM]_

_A JavaScript implementation of Set._

## Features

- Return the Union of two sets
- Return the Intersection of two sets
- Check for the Equality of two sets
- check if two sets are Equivalent
- Return the Compliment of two sets
- Check if two sets are disjoint
- Check if a set is empty
- Return the size of a set
- Clear a set (make it empty)
- add an element to a set

## Here is how to get started.

## Installation

Install using NPM

```sh
npm i js-sets
```

Install using yarn

```sh
yarn add js-sets
```

## Example 1

```
const Set = require('js-sets')
const vowels = new Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'i', 'o', 'u'])
console.log(vowels.value)
// will return ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
const consonants = new Set(['b', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'])

```

To use all the Set's method (e.g to unite two sets, to find set intersection or to check for equality of a set), you simply call the method from the set instance and pass the other set as a paramater on the method.

## Example 2

```
let alphabets = vowels.union(consonants)
console.log(alphabets.result())
// will return ['a','e','i','o', 'u', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g', ...]
```

In the above example we are joining vowels and consonants using the _union()_ method, the method is available in all the set instances.
To get the final value, you can use the _result()_ method.

Instead of passing an initial value as a parameter when creating a new Set, like in the first example, you can create a new set passing no parameter and then later use the _set()_ method to set the values of the set, you can also use this method to change the the entire elements of a set.

## Example 3

```
const alphabets = new Set()
alphabets.set(consonants.union(vowels).result())
console.log(alphabets.value)
// will return ['a','e','i','o', 'u', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g', ...]
```

You can also use the chain commands, calling a method after a method to get the resuts you want.

## Example 4

```
alphabets.intersect(vowels).equal(new Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']))
// wil return true
```

Using the _equal()_ method will return either a Boolean value, so there so there is no need to call the result() method after it, hence calling it will return the value of the set.

| add(param)          | add a new element to a set                                                      |
| remove(param)       | remove an element from a set                                                    |
| equal(param)        | check if a set is equal to a given set                                          |
| equaivalent(param)  | check if a set has the same number of elements with a given set                 |
| compliment(param)   | return the elements that are in the current set which are not in the given set  |
| intersection(param) | return similar elements that are in two sets                                    |
| disjoint(param)     | check if two sets have no elements in common                                    |
| power()             | return the power of a set                                                       |
| result()            | Get the final result (value) after a certain method is use to compare two sets. |

# Note:

All methods that accept parameters except for the _equivalent()_ method, the _result()_ method has to be called at the end as chain method in order to get the result of the operation.
